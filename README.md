# Calculator 

Last week I started the front-end section of my software development course at Northcoders. Using the skills I gained this week in React, HTML and CSS I built a dynamic calculator that not only performs basic operations but also handles complex functionalities like percentage calculations and sign inversion.

First off, we had to plan the development of the app, its functionality, and its states. Planning this and looking back at the plan helped immensely when I was hit with errors later on down the line.

ðŸ”§ Key Features ðŸ”§:

- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Advanced Functions: Percentage and sign inversion.
- User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be intuitive and responsive.
- Efficient State Management: Ensures smooth and accurate real-time calculations.

Challenges Overcome: 

Working with numerical inputs in React was quite challenging (maths isn't my strong point). Managing the state across multiple components, handling edge cases like dividing by zero, and ensuring accurate formatting (avoiding NaN errors) required a lot of trial and error. These challenges increased my debugging skills and understanding of React hooks. 

I'm proud of the final product and the skills I've developed. Looking forward to applying these learnings to more projects!
